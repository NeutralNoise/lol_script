# lol_script

This is a programming language that I have been working on. Its a work in progress
and it doesn't work yet. currently I am working on the VM but I am starting to write
the compiler soon.

## About lol_scpipt
lol_script will be a subset of c with some C++ things throw in. That is all for now.

##### Why do this we don't need another programming language!
Well its because I can. I want to learn how this is done. Plus its fun thinking about it.

## About lol_VM
Its a virtual machine that lol_script runs on. Its still a work in progress and will
change over time.

## Todo

1. Write the rest of the compiler. :P
2. Add some more OP codes. i.e. shifting left.
3. Add lua scripting.
4. Documentation of the VM and compiler design.
5. Dynamically loaded library or lua script for file output on compiler.
6. Dynamically loaded library or lua script for parsing the incoming files.
7. Maybe some other stuff when I get here.
