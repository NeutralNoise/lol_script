# lol_script

This is a programming language that I have been working on. Its a work in progress
and it doesn't work yet. currently I am working on the VM but I am starting to write
the compiler soon.

## About lol_scpipt
lol_script will be a subset of c with some C++ things throw in. That is all for now.

##### Why do this we don't need another programming language!
Well its because I can. I want to learn how this is done. Plus its fun thinking about it.

## About lol_VM
Its a virtual machine that lol_script runs on. Its still a work in progress and will
change over time.

## Known Issues
Currently Doesn't run correctly under Cygwin. So I guess Linux builds will not work either.
