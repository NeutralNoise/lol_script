# Todo

A basic list of some things that need to be done.

## Compiler

1. Write the rest of the compiler. Must compile everything in "Documents/Examples".
2. Math order of operations.
3. Strings. (This may need some memory management stuff.)
4. Function calls.
5. Function variables.
6. Pointers.
7. Add things like (new/malloc/delete/free)
8. Let the program pick what memory a var points at.
9. Inline ASM.
10. Multiable files in a program.
11. Maybe some other stuff when I get here.

## Virtual Machine
1. Add some more OP codes. i.e. shifting left. (based of x86 ASM)
2. Terminal display access.
3. Hard drive acess.
4. Network access.
5. Graphics access (OpenGL?)

## Both
1. Documentation of the VM and compiler design.
2. Comment code for doxygen generation.

## Pipe dreams
1. Embedding within c/c++ programs
  1. Accessing c/c++ functions and data.
  2. C/C++ calling and accessing script functions and data.
2. Add lua scripting.
3. Dynamically loaded library or lua script for file output on compiler.
4. Dynamically loaded library or lua script for parsing the incoming files.
