# Todo

A basic list of some things that need to be done.

## Compiler

1. Write the rest of the compiler. Must compile everything in "Documents/Examples".
2. Math order of operations.
3. Strings. (This may need some memory management stuff.)
3. Let the program pick what memory a var points at
4. Add things like (new/malloc/delete/free)
5. Maybe some other stuff when I get here.

## Virtual Machine
1. Add some more OP codes. i.e. shifting left.
2. Terminal display access.
3. Hard drive acess.
4. Network access.
5. Graphics access (OpenGL?)


## Both
1. Documentation of the VM and compiler design.
2. Comment code for doxygen generation.

## Pipe dreams
1. Add lua scripting.
2. Dynamically loaded library or lua script for file output on compiler.
3. Dynamically loaded library or lua script for parsing the incoming files.
